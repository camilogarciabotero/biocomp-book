## Using Apolo cluster with Slurm

![](imgs-cli/cluster-process.png)

Slurm is a job manager scheduler. It brings order to the jobs sent by users of the clusters and facilitate the process of check the state of the job in the cluster and the actual state of the cluster itself. To do so it has basically three main commands. The first one is `sinfo`

## The Slurm instructions

To send then a job into the computer cluster several instructions should be specified so that the appropriate  scheduling take part [Fig. @fig-slurm-instructions]

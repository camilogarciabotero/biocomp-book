# The command line {#sec-cli}

> In this chapter we will explore the fundamentals of the command line interface (aka CLI). We will distinguish the differences between Unix, CLI, Bash and Terminal and other concepts from the computer sciences.

> As you will see the CLI is composed of several programs enabling the interaction with the machine, we will discuss some of the basics to navigate your machine, and some advance one that enable complex operations and automating tasks.

## Getting started with the command line

Before landing into the CLI let us consider the Unix concept. The first question that comes in this section is: what is Unix? It simply is an operating system (OS). In other words, it is a set of programs that inter-operate with each other to let you communicate with the machine. A very important variant (or clone) of Unix is the very well known OS Linux, which was created by Linus Torvalds from scratch. The most important idea behind Unix based systems is the idea that we can use it to access information and hardware programmatically. Other main feature from Unix-like OS systems is the fact that data is usually stored as text files and the interface by which users communicate with the machine is also text-based (TUI: text user interface as opposed to GUI, graphic user interface).

Almost every computer has a way to interact with or access to the inner elements of the computer. Such interface is called the the command-line-interface [Fig. @fig-terminal].

## File paths

Programs, files and directories on every machine (with Unix-like OS) display hierarchical paths (routes), starting out from the **root** (represented by the back-slash character `/`). The **root** represents the beginning of all the software installed in the machine. And many other files are nested from there forming a tree-like structure for the paths [Fig. @fig-tree]

You can inspect the paths of a nested directory tree using `tree` command in you cli:

``` bash
tree -d -L 1
```
:::

There are basically **two** ways to explore or navigate your file system. If you always represent it from the root, then you are presenting an **absolute path**. For instance the absolute path to my desktop is (`/Users/camilogarcia/Desktop`).

## Basic Unix commands

Given that the vast majority of file systems are organized in file paths, the first question when starting with the CLI is "Where am I?". So Unix tool system is equipped with a bunch of commands but its basic ones are pretty much oriented to answer that question and navigating this text-based interface of files. The following three commands (`pwd`, `cd`, `ls`) will help you conquer the CLI.

### Printing your working directory

To know where you are you can see your current location, that is to *print your working directory* using the `pwd` command.

``` bash
pwd
```

### Change to other directory

``` bash
cd test-dir
```

::: {.callout-tip .column-margin}
Some basic arguments to navigate across your terminal:

``` bash
cd .. # change backwards
cd ~  # change to the home
cd /  # change to the root
cd -  # change to previous dir
```
:::

### Listing files

``` bash
ls 
```

::: {.callout-tip .column-margin}
You can navigate your executed commands by typing {{< fa arrow-up >}} or {{< fa arrow-down >}}.
:::

### Making new directories

``` bash
mkdir test-dir
```

### Creating a file

A simple command to create any file inside your terminal is `touch` it just create a file, but do not allow any editing.

``` bash
touch new-file.txt
```

The `new-file.txt` is empty and created on your current location unless you assign another path when creating it. We suggest to take a look at [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations), especially on how to name files depending on the *case* see [Fig. @fig-naming-files]

### Printing files to the screen

``` bash
cat new-file.txt
```

::: {.callout-tip .column-margin}
When using the CLI at first its common to feal quite slow. Then, a very useful tip to boost the productivity from the command line is the autocompletion of commands by hitting `<tab>` after the initial command.
:::

### Removing files or directories

``` bash
rm
```

::: callout-tip
When having a long command, it becomes practically to go to the beginning or to the end of it. To do so you can use the key combination `Ctrl + A` and `Ctrl + E` respectively.
:::

``` bash
rmdir
```

## Anatomy of a command

There is still many conventions by which the parts of a command line might be called, yet a very standard convention is presented in [Fig. @fig-command]

![A simple command and a convention to call its main components](imgs-cli/command-anatomy.png){#fig-command}

Some other for instance also tend to call the `option` as `flag`. This conventions are powerful because almost any command line interface display this structure (complex one add some other features and simple one tend to lack subcommands).

# Challenge

Bacterial defense mechanisms to avoid bacteriophage infections are abundant. One of these is the restriction-modification system (RM-System), which works by targeting a specific site called *motif*, shared by the phage and bacteria, with methylations. Motifs are commonly represented as a *motif logo* which is a probabilistic representation of the nucleotides in a given position. Find the number of times the motif from [Fig. @fig-motif] appears on *B. tequilensis* EA-CB0015 genome using a command. Assume that probabilities are equal when multiple bases appeared at one site.

## intermediate Unix commands

``` bash
grep 
```

``` bash
sed 
```

``` bash
tr
```

## Version control systems 

As its name suggests, a version control system (VCS) allow you to keep record of the changes happening while working files and directories. Several VCSs have been created but the most popular is [git](https://git-scm.com). It is characterized by being a **distributed** VCS, which means that changes history are recorded locally (whether in a user laptop or user account) in contrast to other **centralized** VCSs that changes are saved on a shared machine or server.

So, why bother to learn a VCS in bioinformatics? Well there are many reasons, but to highlight some of them: i) Since VCSs allow you to record changes, you can always trace back the steps made in ana analysis, which is nice for the **reproducibility** of your work. ii) a system like git could be coupled with a shared-centralized server as it is [GitHub](https://github.com) (we'll talk about it [later](../chs-command-line/git-and-github.qmd#exploring-github) and then one could **share and collaborate**, expanding the extent of your research and iii) following the structures and command from git its at first overwhelming and demands consistency and order, then when scaling a project it will payoff this stepping curve of learning by keeping the **efficiency** of your work.

## Git installation and configuration

Installation could proceed from the official page of [git](https://git-scm.com). If working from WSL it has the binaries preinstalled, so you can jump directly to the configuration. The second step is to configure your user name and an email. with the following lines:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email user@eafit.edu.co
```


You could always user the preferred e-mail. More configurations are available, for instance the preferred editor to work with and so on, you can explore by asking for help `git config --help` or `git config --list`.

### The basics

There are at least **six** basic commands. Three of them allow recording local changes (`git init`, `git add` and `git commit`) and the other three help you to inspect the state of the changes (`git status`, `git diff` and `git log`), we will dive into the detail in the following lines. So, to start recording changes in a directory you must **initialize** the directory (which will now be called repository) using `git init`. This is a one-time command to get started.

### The local workflow

### Ignoring files

the `.gitignore` file.

## Exploring GitHub

As mention before, one of the great advantages that git can later achieve is to collaborate. However, to get into that a sharable server must allow users to have a common ground, and this is what [GitHub](https://github.com/home) allow. GitHub is a web platform where the local repositories become public and any user can access to the controlled versions of an image of your repo. 

To enable the communication with a remote repo, git has encoded many specific commands, once the repos are **cloned** a simple workflow from the own local and remote repos is made possible thanks to two simple commands `git push` and `git pull`. 

There a several ways to starting out a remote project, whether it starts from a local folder or whether it starts from a remote repo. The second strategy is sometimes easier as you just need to later `git clone` the remote into a local folder. To do so every repo has its own code-icon {{< fa code size=scriptsize >}} to later copy the repo link and later hit `git clone <https...>` on the desired folder. Now you got a linked copy of the remote on your machine.

But before working on a remote and pushing your firsts committed changes it is common to find an error regarding the remote branch (also called *origin*). There are several ways to avoid this caveat, but a very anticipated way is to configure git with the following line:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true
```

This will save you from every time typing `git push --set-upstream origin <main>` when working on a new remote repo.

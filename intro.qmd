# Introduction

Here we present a course centered book of the Fundamentals of Computational Biology. We will cover several topics, from using the unix tools, the importance of package manager systems (such as homebrew and conda), sequencing technologies, sequence alignments, molecular phylogenetics, genome assembly and annotation, and variant calling analysis.

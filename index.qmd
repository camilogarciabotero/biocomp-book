# Preface {.unnumbered}

We started this book with the aim of compiling the lectures of the course Fundamentals of Computational Biology offered at Universidad EAFIT for undergrad students in Biology. The course has been taught from different perspectives from its creation, yet the last iteration was divided into three modules. i) introduction to Unix (4 lectures) ii) introduction to sequence analysis and genomics (7 lectures) and iii) principles of structural biology (4 lectures).

Lectures are focused on a theoretical-practical approach where basic concepts from biology, bioinformatics and computer science and interleave with the practice to solve challenges. Excercised or challenges are designed to improve stundents abilities that are likely to be involved in real-life problems in computational biology.

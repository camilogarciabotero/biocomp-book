# Preface {.unnumbered}

We started this book with the aim of compiling the lectures of the course Fundamentals of Computational Biology offered at Universidad EAFIT for undergrad students in Biology. The course has been taught from different perspectives from its creation, yet the last iteration was divided into five introductory modules to i) Unix, ii) sequence analysis, iii) genomics, iii) metagenomics iv) structural biology.

Lectures are focused on a theoretical-practical approach where basic concepts from biology, bioinformatics and computer science and interleave with the practice to solve challenges. Exercised or challenges are designed to improve students' abilities that are likely to be involved in real-life problems in computational biology.

## Learning features {.unnumbered}

::: callout-note
Sometimes other fields might add interested value to the understanding of the computational biology area. This feature remarks some of them and aim to explain these intersections.
:::

::: callout-tip
As you move forward in the computational biology field you will find that there are several tips and tricks (mainly from the command line) as well as some random CLI programs that can leverage your daily workflow as a researcher. Using this feature we highlight some of those that appeared to linger on the field.
:::

::: callout-important
To help you consolidate your understanding we end most chapters with important messages or concepts that help you evaluate yourself as you move forward on the lessons.

# Caution

When experimenting with the CLI and many other computational tools it is common to face several known errors and drawbacks. Then, we present some of them and how to sort them out.

# Challenges

Since focused on a competences learning approach we have highlighted several real-life (but basic) *challenges* a researcher faces when approaching computational biology problem (from tool selection, usage and result analysis). Therefore the book section *challenges* presents a selection of these problems that will later be approached by a computational biology strategy (mainly from the CLI).

# File format

As many analysis specialize on data analysis, many formats arise that optimize the processing steps or the data storing steps. Some of these formats are keystones of bioinformatic analyses. We present examples of some formats an describe its main elements.

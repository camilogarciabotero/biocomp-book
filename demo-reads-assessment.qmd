# Sequence reads assesment

## General stats from fastq files {.unnumbered}

A simple but fast cli to display the general stats from fastq is `seqfu`
```zsh
seqfu stats –n *.gz
```

## A graphical assessment of reads {.unnumbered}

Often its important to assess reads graphically and `nanoplot` offers a complete graphical summary (and general stats as well) of the reads

```zsh
nanoplot –-fastq reads.fastq.gz –-output reads-report
```

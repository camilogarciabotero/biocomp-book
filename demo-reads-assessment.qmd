# Sequence reads assesment

::: {.callout-warning}
## Challenge
Your professor challenges you to assembly a bacterial genome.
He wants to know if  an assembly using Illumina reads or Nanopore reads is better. The raw sequences for Illumina could be downloaded with the code SRR15634574. And the Nanopore raw reads with SRR15634573 here: https://sra-explorer.info. Choose at least on set and follow the instruction from the lecture to assemble the genome. Document each step and send to the professor the `assembly-{your-initials}.fasta`. You could form groups of max. 4 students.

## General stats from fastq files {.unnumbered}

A simple but fast cli to display the general stats from fastq is `seqfu`
```zsh
seqfu stats –n *.gz
```

## A graphical assessment of reads {.unnumbered}

Often its important to assess reads graphically and `nanoplot` offers a complete graphical summary (and general stats as well) of the reads

```zsh
nanoplot –-fastq reads.fastq.gz –-output reads-report
```

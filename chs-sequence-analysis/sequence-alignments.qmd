# Sequence alignments {#sec-aliignments}

## Why do we align sequences?

In search of homology and identy

## What is homology

## Pairwise alignments algorihtms

### Hamming distance

### Edit distance

#### Dynamic programming

### Needleman-Wunsch (global alignment)

### Smith-Waterman (local alignment)

## The genetic code and Scoring matrices

## BLAST and its families

psi-blast? true homologs, recurrent blast to polish scoring matrix during several generations to generate true homologs

## Multiple sequence alignments

# Sanger analysis {#sec-sanger}

> This is a section about perhaps one of the first generation sequencing technology, that is Sanger sequencing and its principles and evolution, strengths and limitations
>
> This chapter will also cover the bioinformatics side of the method: what kind of files we get out Sanger, how we process them and an important paradigm that came out from this sequence method.

> Finally we will dive into a study case that its very common in microbiology: the use of the 16S rRNA gene for taxonomy identification

> This is a section about perhaps one of the first generation sequencing technology, that is Sanger sequencing and its principles and evolution, strengths and limitations

> This chapter will also cover the bioinformatics side of the method: what kind of files we get out Sanger, how we process them and an important paradigm that came out from this sequence method.

## Files from Sanger sequencing

Several files are generated from a modern Sanger sequencing project.

However the most used file is the binary version `AB1` which could be red out from different programs including [cutepeaks](). It displays the DNA sequence along with its quality peak in each position [Fig. @fig-ab1-trace]

## Sanger processing workflow

<!-- :::{.callout-tip .column-margin}
A simple one-line to generate a reverse-complement of a linearized FASTA could be done with three commands:

```{.bash}
tail -n 1 seq.fasta | 
    rev | 
    tr "ATCG" "TAGC" 
```

## Biological information

Since the origin, organisms (or molecules) have been the result of different selective processes. An emergent property of successive iterations of survival/decease was the ability of molecules to keep a record of its past in a very stable manner, so that it will pass generation to generation. Although this might not be the first property or molecule to ever exist (see the [:origin of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis)), the innovation of organisms to pack information of previous events became so advantageous that almost any form of living organism has this property: that is DNA.

![The different scales of information packed in a biological fashion. Figure adapted from @meneely2017 book showing how *DNA in a eukaryote is packaged with chromosomal proteins to form the much more compact chromatin. Chromatin is then folded into higher-order structures and eventually into the chromosome*](imgs-seqan/chromosome-genes.png){#fig-chromosome}

Almost any living organism harbor DNA in a nucleus or chromosome, which is a very compacted structure that could be actually seen to naked eye in some species. It so arranged or condensed [Fig. @fig-chromosome] that it is the result of multiple compacting strategies.

## The duality of DNA

DNA is an organic molecule of [:nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid) that is mainly build out of nitrogen-containing compounds ([:nucleobases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase)) or just bases.The four bases are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and (T) and they bind strictly as $A=T$ and $C\equiv{G}$ where each of the lines represents an hydrogen bond.

DNA nitrogenous bases of are arranged in a very compacted helix structure and too much can be understood from its molecular nature. It is of course governed by the physicochemical properties of the atoms, therefore DNA is a physicochemical entity. But those common bricks have also a very beautiful emergent property that comes out from their order (mainly), and that is to keep the instructions that build the organism from which it belongs. These instructions are nothing else than information, which also follow some informational rules. Then DNA is also an informational entity.

The description of DNA bases helped the elucidation of the helicoidal structure as well as the elucidation of the base pairing rules of the nucleotides [Fig. @fig-nucleotides], also called the Chargaff’s rules of base pairing. The first outstanding feature of the DNA structure was indeed highlighted by Watson and Crick in its famous paper about a subtle mechanism of replication. The

This idea of the duality of the DNA (and of course of other biological molecules as well) is the source of the study of many bioinformatic fields. But a question remains open: how do we capture the informational nature of a DNA sequence so that we end up with a sequential file of characters `ATCGCTATC...`. This is not a trivial question in fact.

## The central ~~dogma~~ theory of molecular biology extended

So far we have addressed that DNA is a very stable molecule that stores biological (i.e., evolutionary) information. Also, that DNA  could represent a sequential object of characters as in a computer digital object or file as well. But how is it that this order has an underlying biological sense? This was a very though question that required the accumulation of many experimental discoveries and the meeting of genetics and molecular biology.

## Sequencing strategies


## Sequencing over time

## Some insights from sequencing genomes



## Biological information databases


## Retrieving data from NCBI


### The manual way

### Entrez direct


We first need to install the [Entrez Direct](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/) command line utilities. This could be done in several ways, one suggested by the manual and a very simple one using conda (mamba).

```{bash}
#| eval: false
mamba create -y –n entrez entrez
```

This line will create a new conda environment called *entrez* and will automatically install all dependencies. We later activate the environment with `conda activate entrez` and then we got the entire Entrez CLI utilities.

There are several commands and its function is to interact with the NCBI databases system. It is, however, a very huge set of utilities and commands to cope with at first, so the learning curve is somehow steppe. Here is a way to download the *Bacillus tequilensis* EA-CB0015 genome with a line of code that interleave three of the main commands of Entrez:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
esearch -db assembly -query GCF_012225885.1 |
elink   -target nucleotide -name assembly_nuccore_refseq | 
efetch  -format fasta > GCF_012225885.1.fasta
```

### A simple program

## Challenge {#sec-challenge-01}

Professor Camilo is interested on knowing how many complete genomes of *Bacillus subtilis* are there in the NCBI databases. He asks you later to count the number of features (genes, CDS, ncRNA, rRNA, etc.) in the genome of *Bacillus subtilis* NCIB 3610 (GCF_002055965.1). And tell you to document each of the steps and how did you end up with the answer. Saving the file with your initials (e.g., CG-activity01.md)

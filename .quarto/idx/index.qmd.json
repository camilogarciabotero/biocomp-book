The course has been taught from different perspectives from its creation, yet the last iteration was divided into three modules. i) introduction to Unix (4 lectures) ii) introduction to sequence analysis and genomics (7 lectures) and iii) principles of structural biology (4 lectures).\n\nLectures are focused on a theoretical-practical approach where basic concepts from biology, bioinformatics and computer science and interleave with the practice to solve challenges. Excercised or challenges are designed to improve stundents abilities that are likely to be involved in real-life problems in computational biology.\n\n## Learning features {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n##\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Challenges {.unnumbered}\n\nSince focused on a competences learning approach we have highlighted several real-life (but basic) *challenges* a researcher faces when approaching computational biology problem, from tool selection, using and result analysis.

In this chapter we will explore the fundamentals of the command line interface (aka CLI). A CLI is actually several things and sometimes simply confused with a terminal window such as the following image:

Before landing into the CLI let us consider the Unix concept. The first question that comes in this section is: what is Unix? It Simply is an operating system (OS). On another terms it is a set of programs that inter-operate with each other to let you communicate with the machine. A very important variant of Unix with a *libre* access is the very known OS Linux.

The most important idea behind Unix based systems is the idea that we can use it to access information and hardware programmatically.

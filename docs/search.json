    "text": "Danger\n\n\n\nThis book is a work in progress\n\n\nWe started this book with the aim of compiling the lectures of the course Fundamentals of Computational Biology offered at Universidad EAFIT for undergrad students in Biology. The course has been taught from different perspectives from its creation, yet the last iteration was divided into three modules. i) introduction to Unix (4 lectures) ii) introduction to sequence analysis and genomics (7 lectures) and iii) principles of structural biology (4 lectures).\nLectures are focused on a theoretical-practical approach where basic concepts from biology, bioinformatics and computer science and interleave with the practice to solve challenges. Excercised or challenges are designed to improve stundents abilities that are likely to be involved in real-life problems in computational biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSometimes other fields might add interested value to the understanding of the computational biology area. This feauture remarks some of them and aim to explain these intersections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you move forward in the computational biology field you will find that there are several tips and tricks (mainly from the command line) as well as some random CLI programs that can leverage your daily workflow as a researcher. Using this feature we highlight some of those that appeared to linger on the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo help you consolidate your understanding we end most chapters with important messages or concepts that help you evaluate yourself as you move forward on the lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhen experimenting with the CLI and many other computational tools it is common to face several known errors and drawbacks. Then, we present some of them and how to sort them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\nSince focused on a competences learning approach we have highlighted several real-life (but basic) challenges a researcher faces when approaching computational biology problem (from tool selection, usage and result analysis). Therefore the book section challenges presents a selection of these problems that will later be apporached by a computational biology strategy (mainly from the CLI).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile format\n\n\n\nAs many analysis specialize on data analysis, many formats arise that optimize the processing steps or the data storing steps. Some of these formats are keystones of bioinformatic analyses. We present examples of some formats an describe its main elements."

It simply is an operating system (OS). On another terms it is a set of programs that inter-operate with each other to let you communicate with the machine. A very important variant of Unix with a libre access is the very known OS Linux. The most important idea behind Unix based systems is the idea that we can use it to access information and hardware programmatically.\nAlmost every computer has a way to interact with or access to the inner elements of the computer. Such interface is called the terminal Fig. 1.1\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A terminal app displaying common features of the command line interface"

    "text": "1.3 Basic Unix commands\nGiven that the vast majority of file systems are orginzed in file paths, the first question when starting with the CLI is “where am I?”. So Unix tool system is equiped with a bunch of commands but its basic ones are pretty much oriented to answer that question and navigating this text-based interface of files. The following three commands (pwd, cd, ls) will help you conquer the CLI.\n\n1.3.1 Printing your working directory\nTo know where you are you can see your current location, that is to print your working directory using the pwd command.\npwd\n\n\n1.3.2 Change to other directory\ncd test-dir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome basic arguments to navigate across your terminal:\ncd .. # change backwards\ncd ~  # change to the home\ncd /  # change to the root\ncd -  # change to previous dir\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Listing files\nls \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can navigate your executed commands by typing  or .\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Making new directories\nmkdir test-dir\n\n\n1.3.5 Creating a file\nA simple command to create any file inside your terminal is touch it just create a file, but do not allow any editing.\ntouch new-file.txt\nThe new-file.txt is empty and created on your current location unless you assign another path when creating it. We suggest to take a look at Allison Horst, especially on how to name files depending on the case see Fig. 1.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Different conventions for naming files or directories as a good computational practice. Such as de the kebab-case or the UpperCammelCase. Illustration by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n1.3.6 Printing files to the screen\ncat new-file.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen using the CLI at first its common to feal quite slow. Then, a very useful tip to boost the productivity from the command line is the autocompletion of commands by hitting <tab> after the initial command.\n\n\n\n1.3.7 Removing files or directories\nrm\nrmdir"

This conventions are powerful becasue almost any command line interface display this structure (complex one add some other features and simple one tend to lack subcomands).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nBacterial defense mechanisms to avoid bacteriophage infections are abundant. One of these is the resctriction-modification system (RM-System), which works by targeting a specific site called motif, shared by the phage and bacteria, with methylations. Motifs are commonly represented as a motif logo which is a probabilistic representation of the nucleotides in a given position. Find the number of times the motif from Figure 1.5 appears on B. tequilensis EA-CB0015 genome using a command. Assume that probabilities are equal when multiple bases appeared at one site.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: A RM-system motif logo"

Natural aminoacids and modified or rare aminoacids display physico-chemical rich information and could be represented by letters. Therefore in the genetic code we could find the one-letter code.\nSecondary structures result from the spatial arrangement of aminoacids that interact with each closer neighbors. There are some remarkable secondary structures such as \\(\\beta\\)-sheets, \\(\\alpha\\)-helix, coils (flexible) and others.\nTertiary structure informs about the structural disposition of the secondary structures that fold between each other due to hydrophobic interactions, disulfure bonds, and other chemical interactions forming a globular and dynamic structure. Thus, proteins could display multiple structural states depending on the physical and energy stability (see the Levinthal’s paradox).\nQuaternary structures result from interaction of multiple tertiary structures. The structure, therefore dictates the protein function. This basic concept have triggered more recently a boom on the analysis of the structure of proteins."

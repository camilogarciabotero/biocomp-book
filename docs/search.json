    "text": "We started this book with the aim of compiling the lectures of the course Fundamentals of Computational Biology offered at Universidad EAFIT for undergrad students in Biology. The course has been taught from different perspectives from its creation. All main units are depicted in this book, although the course is mainly composed from at least four of them. We suggest to cover the first three units/parts and vary the last. Units in this book are partitioned as follows: i) Unix, ii) sequence analysis, iii) genomics, iii) metagenomics iv) RNA seq v) structural biology.\nLectures are focused on a theoretical-practical approach where basic concepts from biology, bioinformatics and computer science and interleave with the practice to solve challenges. Exercises or challenges are designed to improve students’ abilities that are likely to be involved in real-life problems in computational biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\n\nThis book is a work in progress.

    "text": "The present book gathers the lecture notes of the undergrad course in Fundamentals of Computational Biology that takes place in EAFIT University. The first part will focus on how to use the the command line interface (aka CLI). It includes a long-format chapter about the Unix tools and concepts that is taught during the first four class lessons. The second chapter of covers the basics of git and the principal workflows to work daily on a collaborative manner this is actually the second lesson of the course. the importance of package manager systems (such as homebrew and conda or scoop). Later, in a third lesson, we introduce important concepts about how computers handle the tasks or jobs, and the parallelization of them. We talk about the computer architectures, the cluster architectures and the job scheduling software called Slurm, which is used on our local HPC cluster.\nThe second part We will cover several topics sequencing technologies, sequence alignments, molecular phylogenetics. All this topics are covered from the biological perspective, mathematical notions and the practical computing approach. Some of the main bioinformatics file extensions are covered and the\nThird part is focused genomics. It will cover main algorithms for genome assembly and some relevant programs. Also the biological nuances of gene calling and gene annotation, and finally will variant calling analysis, which introduces the gene mapping concept and some of the most important bioinformatics file extensions.\nNext parts are currently optionals for the course per-se and some iterations may only include one of those or some combinations. They are mainly dedicated to introduce metagenomics, differential gene expression analysis and structural bioinformatics."

    "section": "\n1.1 Getting started with the command line",
    "text": "1.1 Getting started with the command line\nBefore landing into the CLI let us consider the Unix concept. The first question that comes in this section is: what is Unix? It simply is an :operating system (OS). In other words, it is a set of programs that inter-operate with each other to let you communicate with the machine. A very important variant (or clone) of Unix is the very well known OS :Linux, which was created by :Linus Torvalds from scratch. The most important idea behind Unix based systems is the idea that we can use it to access information and hardware programmatically. Other main feature from Unix-like OS systems is the fact that data is usually stored as text files and the interface by which users communicate with the machine is also text-based (TUI: text user interface as opposed to GUI, graphic user interface).\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A terminal app displaying common features of the command line interface\n\n\nAlmost every computer has a way to interact with or access to the inner elements of the computer. Such interface is called the the command-line-interface Fig. 1.1.\n\n1.1.1 File paths\nPrograms, files and directories on every machine (with Unix-like OS) display hierarchical paths (routes), starting out from the root (represented by the back-slash character /). The root represents the beginning of all the software installed in the machine. And many other files are nested from there forming a tree-like structure for the paths Fig. 1.2\n\n\nFigure 1.2: A terminal displaying tree-like structure of the programs in a machine with macOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can inspect the paths of a nested directory tree using tree command in you cli:\ntree -d -L 1\n\nThere are basically two ways to explore or navigate your file system. If you always represent it from the root, then you are presenting an absolute path. For instance the absolute path to my desktop is (/Users/camilogarcia/Desktop).\n\n1.1.2 Basic Unix commands\nGiven that the vast majority of file systems are organized in file paths, the first question when starting with the CLI is “Where am I?”. So Unix tool system is equipped with a bunch of commands but its basic ones are pretty much oriented to answer that question and navigating this text-based interface of files. The following three commands (pwd, cd, ls) will help you conquer the CLI.\n\n1.1.2.1 Printing your working directory\nTo know where you are you can see your current location, that is to print your working directory using the pwd command.\npwd\n\n1.1.2.2 Change to other directory\ncd test-dir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome basic arguments to navigate across your terminal:\ncd .. # change backwards\ncd ~  # change to the home\ncd /  # change to the root\ncd -  # change to previous dir\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Listing files\nls \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can navigate your executed commands by typing  or .\n\n\n1.1.2.4 Making new directories\nmkdir test-dir\n\n1.1.2.5 Creating a file\nA simple command to create any file inside your terminal is touch it just create a file, but do not allow any editing.\ntouch new-file.txt\nThe new-file.txt is empty and created on your current location unless you assign another path when creating it. We suggest to take a look at Allison Horst illustrations, especially on how to name files depending on the case see Fig. 1.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Different conventions for naming files or directories as a good computational practice. Such as de the kebab-case or the UpperCammelCase. Illustration by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2.6 Printing files to the screen\ncat new-file.txt\nsome\nlines\nthat\nwere\nwritten\n\n1.1.2.7 Removing files or directories\nrm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen having a long command, it becomes practically to go to the beginning or to the end of it. To do so you can use the key combination Ctrl + A and Ctrl + E respectively.\n\nrmdir\n\n1.1.3 Anatomy of a command\nThere is still many conventions by which the parts of a command line might be called, yet a very standard convention is presented in Fig. 1.4\n\n\nFigure 1.4: A simple command and a convention to call its main components\n\n\nSome other for instance also tend to call the option as flag. This conventions are powerful because almost any command line interface display this structure (complex one add some other features and simple one tend to lack subcommands).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nBacterial defense mechanisms to avoid bacteriophage infections are abundant. One of these is the :restriction-modification system (RM-System), which works by targeting a specific sites called motifs, shared by the phage and bacteria, with methylations. Motifs are commonly represented as a :sequence logo which is a probabilistic representation of the nucleotides at each position. The challenge consists of finding the number of times the motif from Fig. 1.5 appears on B. tequilensis EA-CB0015 genome using a command. Assume that probabilities are equal when multiple bases appeared at one site.\n\n\nFigure 1.5: A RM-system motif logo\n\n\nBefore diving into an :answer take your time to think and solve it by your own."

Many RE are directed to specific DNA motifs normally palindromic. There are mainly three types according to it digestive mechanism. RE have been widely used in molecular biotechnology because its specificity and versatility to carry out different experiments.\nOne of the main uses of RE is to generate a pattern of restricted fragments from different organisms so that samples of organisms, sequences or genes could be distinguished, as long as they display differences in the number of recognition motifs. This is normally done in the lab, where an RE is mixed with a DNA sample and later an :electrophoresis gel is run to see a separation pattern according to the fragments size.\nProfessor Javier has sequenced the genome of a sampled SARS-CoV2 and want to see the band pattern that the genome would display if it were digested with the RE EcoRV. He has asked you to help him with this problem. The expected output is a text file with the sizes of the fragments, where the size is the number of nucleotides of each fragment.\n\n\nFor more explanations on the basic commands in the command line we suggest to visit the first chapters of Computing skills for biologist from Allesina and Wilmes (2019)\n\n\n\n\nAllesina, Stefano, and Madlen Wilmes. 2019. “Computing Skills for Biologists,” January. https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctvc77jrc."

Several VCSs have been created but the most popular is git. It is characterized by being a distributed VCS, which means that changes history are recorded locally (whether in a user laptop or user account) in contrast to other centralized VCSs that changes are saved on a shared machine or server.\nSo, why bother to learn a VCS in bioinformatics? Well there are many reasons, but to highlight some of them: i) Since VCSs allow you to record changes, you can always trace back the steps made in ana analysis, which is nice for the reproducibility of your work. ii) a system like git could be coupled with a shared-centralized server as it is GitHub (we’ll talk about it later and then one could share and collaborate, expanding the extent of your research and iii) following the structures and command from git its at first overwhelming and demands consistency and order, then when scaling a project it will payoff this stepping curve of learning by keeping the efficiency of your work."

However, to get into that a sharable server must allow users to have a common ground, and this is what GitHub allow. GitHub is a web platform where the local repositories become public and any user can access to the controlled versions of an image of your repo. The famous pet is the octocat Fig. 2.1\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The octocat from GitHub\n\nTo enable the communication with a remote repo, git has encoded many specific commands, once the repos are cloned a simple workflow from the own local and remote repos is made possible thanks to two simple commands git push and git pull.\nThere a several ways to starting out a remote project, whether it starts from a local folder or whether it starts from a remote repo. The second strategy is sometimes easier as you just need to later git clone the remote into a local folder. To do so every repo has its own code-icon  to later copy the repo link and later hit git clone <https...> on the desired folder. Now you got a linked copy of the remote on your machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nBut before working on a remote and pushing your first commits, it is common to find an error regarding the remote branch (also called origin). There are several ways to avoid this caveat, but a very anticipated way is to configure git\n\ngit config --global push.autoSetupRemote true\n\nThis will save you from every time typing git push --set-upstream origin <main> when working on a new remote repo.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The cloning workflow in brief\n\n\nCloning is therefore the process of creating a local copy of remote repository, that is a machine version of the remote repo, later all the common local workflow is carried out normally Fig. 2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to keep a file out of synchronization git provides a simple way to do so by creating a .gitignore file having the the paths to the files to keep in your local machine\n\n\n2.3.1 Forking and collaborate\nBasic collaboration on an open repository is a three-step process. First you need to fork the repo, this will create a mirror copy of the repo in your GitHub profile. In a second step, a simple clone of the repo will generate a copy of the forked repo on your local machine, so you can freely work and make your mistakes and push them to your forked repo that belongs to your account. In a third step, once they are on the remote repo you will have to create a pull request (PR), as its name suggest: you are asking the owners of the original to consider your changes Fig. 2.3.\n\n\nFigure 2.3: A common collaborative workflow from GitHub, using fork, clone and pull requests\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Branching and merging"

Although this might not be the first property or molecule to ever exist (see the :origin of life), the innovation of organisms to pack information of previous events became so advantageous that almost any form of living organism has this property: that is DNA.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: The different scales of information packed in a biological fashion.

It is of course governed by the physicochemical properties of the atoms, therefore DNA is a physicochemical entity. But those common bricks have also a very beautiful emergent property that comes out from their order (mainly), and that is to keep the instructions that build the organism from which it belongs. These instructions are nothing else than information, which also follow some informational rules. Then DNA is also an informational entity.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: DNA double helix structure and main characteristics.

The first outstanding feature of the DNA structure was indeed highlighted by Watson and Crick in its famous paper about a subtle mechanism of replication.\nThis idea of the duality of the DNA (and of course of other biological molecules) is the source of the study of many bioinformatic fields.

But how is it that this order has an underlying biological sense? This was a very though question that required the accumulation of many experimental discoveries and the meeting of genetics and molecular biology."

There are some remarkable secondary structures such as \\(\\beta\\)-sheets, \\(\\alpha\\)-helix, coils (flexible) and others.\nTertiary structure informs about the structural disposition of the secondary structures that fold between each other due to hydrophobic interactions, disulfure bonds, and other chemical interactions forming a globular and dynamic structure. Thus, proteins could display multiple structural states depending on the physical and energy stability (see the :Levinthal’s paradox).\nQuaternary structures result from interaction of multiple tertiary structures. The structure, therefore dictates the protein function. This basic concept have triggered more recently a boom on the analysis of the structure of proteins."

    "text": "The first thing we must do to solve the Challenge is download the sequence of interest. In Ch 1 the genome of Bacillus tequilensis EA-CB0015 is proposed. There are several ways to do so. A simple way is to search in the NCBI databases for the entire genome and download as FASTA file (we cover the properties of this file format in Ch 5).\nWhen inspecting the file we see the following lines at the top\n>NZ_CP048852.1 Bacillus tequilensis strain EA-CB0015 chromosome, complete genome\nATGGAAAATATATTAGACCTGTGGAATCAAGCCCTTGCTCAAATCGAAAAAAAGTTGAGCAAACCGAGTTTTGAGACTTG\nGATGAAATCCACCAAAGCCCACTCACTGCAGGGAGATACACTGACGATCACGGCTCCCAATGAATTTGCCAGAGACTGGC\nTGGAGTCCAGATACTTGCATCTGATTGCAGATACTATATATGAATTAACCGGGGAAGAATTGAGCATTAAGTTTGTCATT\nCCTCAAAATCAAGATGTTGAGGACTTTATGCCAAAGCCGCAAGTCAAAAAAGCGGTTAAAGAAGATACATCTGATTTTCC\nThe file is about 4 Mb and it is heavy to be opened in any editor. Therefore when looking for a pattern it becomes more useful the CLI.\nA first attempt to do is simply by using grep for the pattern presented on Fig. 1.5. So a first problem you will find is to represent multiple characters in one position of the pattern. There is a fantastic tool to so and its called regular expressions (regex). a regex is a way to encode groups of characters using single characters. For instance the character * (wildcards) represents any character, so it groups all characters and it is used broadly on the CLI. There are many regex dialects however and for grep the dot . represents any character and when the pipe | represents an special operator in the CLI, for grep regex it represents and OR operator.\nSo, the second step is to create our regular expression. Note the there are six characters in the expression that can adopt different characters. So our first regex is TAAA(T|A)(.)(T|A)(G|A)(.)(C|A)GGT. In the expression the parenthesis allow groups of characters.\nNow lets see if we can search for that pattern using grep and the appropriate option for using regex, which in this case is -E. Another simply way to use the grep -E combination is to use simple egrep command plus the -c option to count the number of lines where the pattern appears.\n\negrep -c \"TAAA(T|A)(.)(T|A)(G|A)(.)(C|A)GGT\" data/Bteq-genome.fasta\n\n43\n\n\nIs this the solution? One might think it is solved. However, there are several issues to be aware. First egrep -c is counting the lines, what if in one line there are multiple matches? Then, the approach will showing a value under the actual number of motifs. So a way to solve that is to capture and extract the matches and print them out. A way to do that is to use the option -o which actually prints only the matching part of the lines, and then count them.\n\negrep -oc \"TAAA(T|A)(.)(T|A)(G|A)(.)(C|A)GGT\" data/Bteq-genome.fasta\n\n43\n\n\nThe outcome is the same tough. So is it solved? Every NCBI genome that is downloaded display a distinct character besides de nucleotide sequence. Every several number of nucleotides there is a new line \\n that enables the wrapping file into multiple lines. Therefore some motifs could be shopped by the \\n character so they will never appear with the regex used. A way to circumvent this issue is deleting the \\n in the entire file. We can easily do that with the translate tr command:\n\ntr -d '\\n' < data/Bteq-genome.fasta\n\n>NZ_CP048852.1 Bacillus tequilensis strain EA-CB0015 chromosome, complete genomeATGGAAAATATATTAGACCTGTGGAATCAAGCCCTTGCTCAAATCGAAAAAAAGTTGAGCAAACCGAGTTTTGAGACTTGGATGAAATCCACCAAAGCCCACTCACTGCAGGGAGATACACTGACGATCACGGCTCCCAATGAATTTGCCAGAGACTGGCTGGAGTCCAGATACTTGCATCTGATTGCAGATACTATATATGAATTAACCGGGGAAGAATTGAGCATTAAGTTTGTCATTCCTCAAAATCAAGATGTTGAGGACTTTATGCCAAAGCCGCAAGTCAAAAAAGCGGTTAAAGAAGATACATCTGATTTTCC...\nThe genome now lies in an entire and unique line along with its title. A way to chain the commands without creating intermediate files is by using the pipe | character. At the end we will use wc -l to count the occurrence (although grep has its own count option \\c it is inconvenient because it will count the lines and now the lines of the exact matches provided by the -o option and as we have just one line, then only will count to 1).\n\ntr -d '\\n' < data/Bteq-genome.fasta |\n    egrep -o \"TAAA(T|A)(.)(T|A)(G|A)(.)(C|A)GGT\" |\n    wc -l\n\n      50\n\n\nAre there yet? Well it turns out that the genome file contains only the 5’-3’ strand of the genome. What about the other strands patterns? To search them we need to generate the reverse-complement (RC) of the motif so we are sure that they will appear when looking the 5’-3’ strand. The RC regex will be ACC(T|G)(.)(T|C)(T|A)(.)(T|A)TTTA\" and adding this regex to the search willl be:\n\ntr -d '\\n' < data/Bteq-genome.fasta |\n    egrep -o \"TAAA(T|A)(.)(T|A)(G|A)(.)(C|A)GGT|ACC(T|G)(.)(T|C)(T|A)(.)(T|A)TTTA\" |\n    wc -l\n\n      94"

The course has been taught from different perspectives from its creation, yet the last iteration was divided into three modules. i) introduction to Unix (4 lectures) ii) introduction to sequence analysis and genomics (7 lectures) and iii) principles of structural biology (4 lectures).\nLectures are focused on a theoretical-practical approach were basic concepts from biology, bioinformatics and computer science and interleave with the practice to solve challenges."

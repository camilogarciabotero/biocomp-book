    "text": "Danger\n\n\n\nThis book is a work in progress\n\n\nWe started this book with the aim of compiling the lectures of the course Fundamentals of Computational Biology offered at Universidad EAFIT for undergrad students in Biology. The course has been taught from different perspectives from its creation, yet the last iteration was divided into three modules. i) introduction to Unix (4 lectures) ii) introduction to sequence analysis and genomics (7 lectures) and iii) principles of structural biology (4 lectures).\nLectures are focused on a theoretical-practical approach where basic concepts from biology, bioinformatics and computer science and interleave with the practice to solve challenges. Excercised or challenges are designed to improve stundents abilities that are likely to be involved in real-life problems in computational biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSometimes other fields might add interested value to the understanding of the computational biology area. This feauture remarks some of them and aim to explain these intersections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you move forward in the computational biology field you will find that there are several tips and tricks (mainly from the command line) as well as some random CLI programs that can leverage your daily workflow as a researcher. Using this feature we highlight some of those that appeared to linger on the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo help you consolidate your understanding we end most chapters with important messages or concepts that help you evaluate yourself as you move forward on the lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhen experimenting with the CLI and many other computational tools it is common to face several known errors and drawbacks. Then, we present some of them and how to sort them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\nSince focused on a competences learning approach we have highlighted several real-life (but basic) challenges a researcher faces when approaching computational biology problem (from tool selection, usage and result analysis). Therefore the book section challenges presents a selection of these problems that will later be apporached by a computational biology strategy (mainly from the CLI).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile format\n\n\n\nAs many analysis specialize on data analysis, many formats arise that optimize the processing steps or the data storing steps. Some of these formats are keystones of bioinformatic analyses. We present examples of some formats an describe its main elements."

    "text": "1.1 Getting started with the command line\nBefore landing into the CLI let us consider the Unix concept. The first question that comes in this section is: what is Unix? It Simply is an operating system (OS). On another terms it is a set of programs that inter-operate with each other to let you communicate with the machine. A very important variant of Unix with a libre access is the very known OS Linux. The most important idea behind Unix based systems is the idea that we can use it to access information and hardware programmatically.\nAlmost every computer has a way to interact with or access to the inner elements of the computer. Such interface is called the terminal Fig. 1.1\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A terminal app displaying common features of the command line interface"

    "text": "1.2 Basic Unix commands\nPrograms, files and directories on every machine display hierarchical paths (routes), starting out from the root (/). The root represents the beginning of all the software installed in the machine. And many other files are nested from there forming a tree-like structure for the paths Fig. 1.2\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: A figure displaying tree-like structure of the programs in a machine with macOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can inspect the paths of a nested directory tree using tree command in you cli:\ntree -d -L 1\n\n\n1.2.1 Printing your working directory\nTo know where you are you can see your current location, that is to print your working directory using the pwd command.\npwd .\n\n\n1.2.2 Making new directories\nmkdir test-dir\n\n\n1.2.3 Change to other directory\ncd test-dir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome basic arguments to navigate across your terminal:\ncd .. # change backwards\ncd ~  # change to the home\ncd /  # change to the root\ncd -  # change to previous dir\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Creating a file\nA simple command to create any file inside your terminal is touch it just create a file, but do not allow any editing.\ntouch new-file.txt\nThe new-file.txt is empty and created on your current location unless you assign another path when creating it. We suggest to take a look at Allison Horst, especially on how to name files depending on the case see Fig. 1.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Different conventions for naming files or directories as a good computational practice. Such as de the kebab-case or the UpperCammelCase. Illustration by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Listing files\nls \n\n\n1.2.6 Printing files to the screen\ncat new-file.txt\nFor more explanations on the basic commands in the command line we suggest to visit the first chapters of Computing skills for biologist from Allesina and Wilmes (2019)"

Although, it could be focused on different biological macro-molecules, here the emphasis will be focused on proteins.\nOne of the first protein structure elucidated was myoglobin and it triggered the study of the role of the structure of proteins and its biological functions\nIdentify a protein related to your study that could be further analyzed."

    "text": "11.1 Protein structures\nDifference between the levels of protein structure primary structure is the basic linear representation of aminoacids. Natural aminoacids and modified or rare aminoacids display physico-chemical rich information and could be represented by letters. Therefore in the genetic code we could find the one-letter code.\nSecondary structures result from the spatial arrangement of aminoacids that interact with each closer neighbors. There are some remarkable secondary structures such as \\(\\beta\\)-sheets, \\(\\alpha\\)-helix, coils (flexible) and others.\nTertiary structure informs about the structural disposition of the secondary structures that fold between each other due to hydrophobic interactions, disulfure bonds, and other chemical interactions forming a globular and dynamic structure. Thus, proteins could display multiple structural states depending on the physical and energy stability (see the Levinthal’s paradox).\nQuaternary structures result from interaction of multiple tertiary structures. The structure, therefore dictates the protein function. This basic concept have triggered more recently a boom on the analysis of the structure of proteins."

    "text": "Danger\n\n\n\nThis book is a work in progress\n\n\nWe started this book with the aim of compiling the lectures of the course Fundamentals of Computational Biology offered at Universidad EAFIT for undergrad students in Biology. The course has been taught from different perspectives from its creation, yet the last iteration was divided into three modules. i) introduction to Unix (4 lectures) ii) introduction to sequence analysis and genomics (7 lectures) and iii) principles of structural biology (4 lectures).\nLectures are focused on a theoretical-practical approach where basic concepts from biology, bioinformatics and computer science and interleave with the practice to solve challenges. Excercised or challenges are designed to improve stundents abilities that are likely to be involved in real-life problems in computational biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSometimes other fields might add interested value to the understanding of the computational biology area. This feauture remarks some of them and aim to explain these intersections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you move forward in the computational biology field you will find that there are several tips and tricks (mainly from the command line) as well as some random CLI programs that can leverage your daily workflow as a researcher. Using this feature we highlight some of those that appeared to linger on the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo help you consolidate your understanding we end most chapters with important messages or concepts that help you evaluate yourself as you move forward on the lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhen experimenting with the CLI and many other computational tools it is common to face several known errors and drawbacks. Then, we present some of them and how to sort them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\nSince focused on a competences learning approach we have highlighted several real-life (but basic) challenges a researcher faces when approaching computational biology problem (from tool selection, usage and result analysis). Therefore the book section challenges presents a selection of these problems that will later be apporached by a computational biology strategy (mainly from the CLI).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile format\n\n\n\nAs many analysis specialize on data analysis, many formats arise that optimize the processing steps or the data storing steps. Some of these formats are keystones of bioinformatic analyses. We present examples of some formats an describe its main elements."

It Simply is an operating system (OS). On another terms it is a set of programs that inter-operate with each other to let you communicate with the machine. A very important variant of Unix with a libre access is the very known OS Linux. The most important idea behind Unix based systems is the idea that we can use it to access information and hardware programmatically.\nAlmost every computer has a way to interact with or access to the inner elements of the computer. Such interface is called the terminal Fig. 1.1\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A terminal app displaying common features of the command line interface"

Natural aminoacids and modified or rare aminoacids display physico-chemical rich information and could be represented by letters. Therefore in the genetic code we could find the one-letter code.\nSecondary structures result from the spatial arrangement of aminoacids that interact with each closer neighbors. There are some remarkable secondary structures such as \\(\\beta\\)-sheets, \\(\\alpha\\)-helix, coils (flexible) and others.\nTertiary structure informs about the structural disposition of the secondary structures that fold between each other due to hydrophobic interactions, disulfure bonds, and other chemical interactions forming a globular and dynamic structure. Thus, proteins could display multiple structural states depending on the physical and energy stability (see the Levinthal’s paradox).\nQuaternary structures result from interaction of multiple tertiary structures. The structure, therefore dictates the protein function. This basic concept have triggered more recently a boom on the analysis of the structure of proteins."

A CDS tends to genereate a codon-like alignment starting with the methione codon (ATG,GTG) and finishing with a stop (TAA, TAG, etc.). Therefore finding this structure when aligning a complete genes is expected. If a middle fraction of the gene is being aligned ORF might not display any stop codon. Verifying a codon-like alignment shows a biological order on the sequences other that mere artifact of the alignment, that is an evolutionary behavior of the sequence. We can do it usin seqfu from the CLI or interactively with AliView.\nA second step is to find the variability of the alignment. A simple way to find that is to calculate simpl stats from the alignment (sites, variable sites, As, Ts, etc.).

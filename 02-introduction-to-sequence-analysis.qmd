# Introduction to sequence analysis

In this chapter we will discuss several about several points of view about bioinformatics and computational biology and how to get started with the command line being a biologist, we will further consider several biological concepts that appear central to understand the manipulation of biological data.

## Endless debate: bioinformatics vs. computational biology

## Getting started with the command line

## The duality of DNA

## The central ~dogma~ theory of molecular biology extended

## Sequencing strategies

## Sequencing over time

## Some insights from sequencing genomes
